                <p>End customers can access software programmes online thanks to the cloud-based software delivery paradigm known as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). In a SaaS model, the software is maintained and updated by the service provider, hosted on remote servers, and made accessible to customers through web browsers, mobile apps, and APIs. Since the early 2000s, the SaaS operating model has been increasingly widespread, helped in part by the emergence of cloud computing. The cost and complexity of implementing and operating SaaS applications have been significantly lowered because to developments in cloud computing, which have made it possible to provide software applications over the internet utilising distant servers.
